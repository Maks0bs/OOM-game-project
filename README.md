    <h1> OOM Game Project </h1>
    <h2> Game info </h2>
    <h3> Running the game </h3>
    <p> Right now game is not compiled into a production build. It can only be run through the IDE (at least for now). </p>
    <p> To run the game you also need to add gameCore.jar as a library in the project. This file is in the gameCore directory of this repo. This file is essential for all game processes</p>
    <h3> Game process </h3>
    <p> The character spawns in the top left corner (please do not go out of bounds of the world, game might crash, this will be addressed in the future). </p>
    <p> To move the character use WASD keys. To pick up weapon, come up to the lying item and press F. Character stats will be displayed in console. </p>
    <p> To enchant the current weapon, press E. Stats will be shown in console. </p>
    <h3> Visuals </h3>
    <p> The world is not static. After the character is in the center of the screen, the renderable field starts moving together with the character. Just try some actions and experiment. Feedback is welcomed. </p>
    <h3> Docs </h3>
    <p> The code in project uses JavaDocs, but they are not complete and still being developed. </p>
    <h2> Technical stuff </h2>
