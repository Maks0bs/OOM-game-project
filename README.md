    the <code>res/</code> folders should be in the same directory
    as the <code>OOM_game_project.jar</code> file. To run the game simply
    open the jar file or open the command line in the directory with
    all above mentioned files and type <code>java -jar OOM_game_project.jar</code>
    JDK 11+ might be required to run this game.
    </p>
    <p>You can clone the repo and run the code in your IDE as well</p>
    <h3>Game process</h3>
    <p> The character spawns in the top left corner (please do not go out of bounds of the world, game might crash, this will be addressed in the future). </p>
    <p> To move the character use <code>WASD</code> keys. To pick up weapon, come up to the lying item and press <code>F</code>. Character stats will be displayed in console. </p>
    <p> To enchant the current weapon, press <code>E</code>. Stats will be shown in console. </p>
    <p>
        To show in-game help press <code>ESC</code> while the game is running
        and select the option to display help. There you will
        find a list of all possible actions and how
        to perform them
    </p>
    <h3> Visuals </h3>
    <p> The world is not static. After the character is in the center of the screen, the renderable field starts moving together with the character. Just try some actions and experiment. Feedback is welcomed. </p>
    <h3> Docs </h3>
    <p> The code uses JavaDocs, but they are not complete and still being developed. </p>
    <h2> Technical stuff </h2>
    <h3> Notes in code </h3>
    <p> FIXME in code means a feature/bug that should be fixed asap. TODO in code means a long-term thing that is not mandatory to be implemented right away. </p>
    <h3> Code </h3>
    <p> 
        The code contains a lot of well-known patterns. This project was
        a way to practice implementing all of these patterns. The code is maintainable
        but might now be very clean at times ðŸ˜„.
